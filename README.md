## What is TS2D?

**TotalSegmentator 2D (TS2D)** is a fast and lightweight tool for anatomical structure segmentation and analysis.<br>
It adapts [TotalSegmentator (3D)](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) by projecting CT scans into **2D views**, enabling:

- ‚ö° **Rapid inference** (results in less than a second, compared to several minutes for 3D methods)
- üíª **Low GPU/CPU requirements**  
- üß† **Accurate segmentation** of 117 anatomical structures (see `ts2d-v2` models)
- ü©ª **Segmentation of native 2D X-ray scans** (see the upcoming `tsxr` models)

**Use cases include**:
- Anatomical structure segmentation and analysis in CT images.
- Body-region segmentation and detection in CT scans.
- X-ray analysis (coming soon)

## How It Works

TS2D uses coronal projection images generated through maximum and average intensity projection for the segmentation of anatomical structures. 
The two-channel input is processed by a 2D U-Net, implemented using our [adapted nnU-Net framework](https://github.com/risc-mi/nnUNet-multilabel/blob/main/readme.md) to support multi-label 
output and thus correctly handle overlapping structures (see Figure 1). 
Pretrained models for both version 1 and version 2 of TotalSegmentator are available. Version 2 supports segmentation of 117 anatomical labels.
The segmentation task was distributed across five specialized models, each focused on a distinct group of anatomical structures (see Figure 2).

TS2D was evaluated using projected ground-truth labels and its performance was compared to the original TotalSegmentator tool (TS3D), with both methods' inference results projected to 2D for consistency.
A comprehensive comparison can be found in our publication \[MIUA2025a\].

## Usage

### Setup

TS2D has been tested with **Python 3.12** and Pytorch 2.7.1 (CUDA 11.8) on a **Windows 11** system and on Ubuntu (tested with CPU only).

üëâ Install PyTorch **before** installing TS2D (see [PyTorch setup](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)).

Then install TS2D via:
- from PyPI: `pip install ts2d`
- from a local clone: `pip install .`
- from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/risc-mi/totalsegmentator2D.git`.


### Get Started

You can run TS2D using the Command line interface (CLI):

`ts2d -i <input_image> -o <output_directory>`

or alternatively, you can use the API to run TS2D in your Python scripts:

```
from ts2d import TS2D
with TS2D() as model:
    result = model.predict('<input_image>')
    result.save(dest='<output_directory>')
```

TS2D will project the input image, run the segmentation models and save a multilabel segmentation file to the output directory.
The segmentation labels can be parsed from the metadata, to view the segmentation use e.g. 3D Slicer to view the results.
For more information, refer to the CLI help or the API documentation.

### Model overview

The following models are available in TS2D have been published and can be specified using the `--model` argument in the CLI or the `key` parameter in the API:

| Model | Dataset | Configuration |   Group   |          Model ID          | Test Dice |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------:|:---------:|
| TS2D  | v2.0.1  |   ep4000b2    |  cardiac  |  ts2d-v2-ep4000b2_cardiac  |   0.72    |
|       |         |               |  muscles  |  ts2d-v2-ep4000b2_muscles  |   0.96    |
|       |         |               |  organs   |  ts2d-v2-ep4000b2_organs   |   0.78    |
|       |         |               |   ribs    |   ts2d-v2-ep4000b2_ribs    |   0.88    |
|       |         |               | vertebrae | ts2d-v2-ep4000b2_vertebrae |   0.88    |
|       | v1.0.0  |   ep4000b2    |  cardiac  |  ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_cardiac  |   0.77    |
|       |         |               |  muscles  |  ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_muscles  |   0.93    |
|       |         |               |  organs   |  ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_organs   |   0.78    |
|       |         |               |   ribs    |   ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_ribs    |   0.89    |
|       |         |               | vertebrae | ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_vertebrae |   0.90    |
|       |         |   ep10000b2   |   bones   |  ts2d-v1-ep10000b2_bones   |   0.88    |
|       |         |               |   soft    |   ts2d-v1-ep10000b2_soft   |   0.81    |


Models are specified using a key (e.g., `ts2d`), which can resolve to one or more model IDs (e.g., `ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_organs`).  
A model ID follows the structure `<model>-<dataset>-<configuration>_<group>`. For example, `ts2d-v1-ep4000b2_organs` refers to the TS2D model trained on the TotalSegmentator v1 dataset, with 4000 epochs, batch size 2, for the organ group.  
Model keys can be abbreviated to match multiple models; for instance, `ts2d-v1-ep4000b2` includes all anatomical groups in that configuration. If only `ts2d` is specified, the default models are used (cardiac, muscles, organs, ribs and vertebrae).

TS2D runs all models matching the specified key and merges their outputs into a single segmentation.  
The default model key is `ts2d-v2-ep4000b2`, which includes the five anatomical group models in this configuration.
